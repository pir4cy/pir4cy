# Hello Friend

Hello and welcome to my blog! This is where I'll ~~shitpost~~ write about my experiences in the world of tech and cybersecurity.  


![Cover Pic](/images/blog/ep1_hellofriend.png)  

## A Blog in 2025? 

I wanted to have a way to document everything I'm doing as well as share what I can with the rest of the world.

While most of the world focuses on information-dense short form content, I find that text is still the best way to learn. Most of what I have learned has been from reading and it is one of the best ways to understand and learn about a subject.

In 2025, it is extremely easy to get started with setting something up for yourself and I finally caved in and started this website. 

## Starting Out

We often end up waiting to finish a certain goal before announcing it to the world. With this blog, I'm taking the approach of sharing my journey towards my goals, so you can experience the journey with me. Think of this as a mix between a lab notebook and a casual chat with a friend who's equally obsessed with tech.

### What to Expect

- Writeups of my adventures in cybersecurity.
- Random projects I'm working on.
- Nerding out over open source technology.
- Maybe some memes (no promises)

### Why Read This?

If you're:
- Interested in reading about tech/security topics.
- Looking for writeups to CTFs and challenges.
- Interested in following along the learning process.
- Bored and need something to read. 

Then you might find something interesting here. I'll try to keep things light, but also make sure there's actual useful content mixed in with the jokes.

## The Journey Ahead

I'm excited to share my experiences, both the successes and the setbacks. Because let's be real - we all have those moments where we spend hours debugging only to find out we missed a semicolon.

So grab your favorite beverage (aka caffeine), and let's dive into this together. 

See you in the next post! Till then, feel free to go through my older writeups! 

> P.S: Yes, the name is the same as Mr Robot's first episode. But I thought what else can fit better at the start of a blog meant to share and mostly post my journey into tech and security as a whole.
